    <span class= "title">Creative Artificial Intelligence: Exploring the Qualities of Popular AI Art Tools</span> <br>
    <span class= "description">The National High School Journal of Science | August 2024</span> <br>
    <span class= "details"> <ul>
        <span> Abstract: Research into the effectiveness of AI art tools suggests that generated images are becoming increasingly indistinguishable from human-made artworks, yet perceived value has generated inconclusive results. This study implements a correlational method to explore the relationship between generated images from different AI tools and their perceived value and distinguishability by comparing them to human-made artworks with similar artistic styles. Value, in the given context, is defined as aesthetic appreciation, monetary worth, and perceived meaningfulness. Results imply that expensive tools provided the most human-like, though not the most valued images as they generated works that were most often mistaken as human artworks. Perceived value among different AI tools was similar and created considerable overlap between ratings for each tool. The average perceived value was higher for human artwork than generated works for all measured variables, though no significant difference was found. The provided results inspire further research into the effectiveness of AI tools. As AI art tools continue to develop to create more human-like images with greater perceived value, the current state of traditional art is threatened as some believe AI art may devalue human art. Regardless, the evolution of art through technology can break the current barriers of traditional art by allowing new degrees of freedom for digital artists. </span>
