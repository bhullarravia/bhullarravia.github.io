        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <h2 class = "about-para"> I am a student at Kent State University's class of 2029 pursuing a major in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Engineering. I have studied computer science since my sophomore year of high school and have developed experience in Java, C++, and JavaScript. Outside of classes, I like to heighten my understanding of my fields of interest through research in machine learning and data science. I have also served as an instructor with Kode With Klossy and previously worked with Girls Who Code, where I supported and encouraged underrepresented students to pursue futures in technology. I constantly seek opportunities to enhance my skills and implement them in real-world situations. Outside of my academic and professional interests, I enjoy chalk pastels, hiking, and building with Legos.
